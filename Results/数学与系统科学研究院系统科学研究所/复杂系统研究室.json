When I was in middle school, I was thrilled with computer algorithm and data structures, finally I co-authored a book  (1993, Zhongshan University Press). This earned me the entrance to univesity without the National Entrance Exam. The change point in my career was in spring 1998, I decided to work on Complex Systems when I read the book . I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science in July 2002 from department of Computer Science and Technology in University of Science and Technology of China(USTC). My thesis was on Multi-agent algorithms to Combinatorial Optimization Problems. I was selected as the 2000-2002 international fellow of the Santa Fe Institute. I worked as a joint post-doc of Institute of Systems Science of Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science(AMSS) of Chinese Academy of Sciences(China) and the Santa Fe Institute (USA) from Aug.2002 to June 2004. After that, I became faculty researcher of the Complex Systems Research Center in AMSS. My other important position is the mother of a 6-year old little girl. She is another complex adaptive system that I am working very hard on.", "directions": "Complex Adaptive Systems\nCollective Behavior and Intervention of Multi-Agent Systems\nCombinatorial Optimization Problems\nCombinatorial Games", "talent_title": null, "administrative_title": null, "education_experience": null, "work_experience": null, "patent": null, "project": "Soft-control on Multi-agent Systems\nGame-based approach to Complex Adaptive Systems", "award": "2000-2002 international fellow of the Santa Fe Institute", "paper": "1.
